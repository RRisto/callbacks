## Callbacks

Implementation of callbacks in training loop. Some of the code is from [here](https://medium.com/@edwardeasling/implementing-callbacks-in-fast-ai-1c23de25b6eb), 
[here](https://sgugger.github.io/how-do-you-find-a-good-learning-rate.html) 
and from [fastbook](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook). Code is used to understand how to use callbacks in training loop:

- There is a simple simple [example](https://github.com/RRisto/callbacks/blob/master/without_callbacks.py) of training loop without callbacks

- [Example](https://github.com/RRisto/callbacks/blob/master/with_callbacks.py) of training loop with callbacks

- [Example](https://github.com/RRisto/callbacks/blob/master/with_callbacks_lr_finder.py) of learning rate finder with callbacks

Data is from fastbook MNIST example dataset.
